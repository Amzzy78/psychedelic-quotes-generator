# Psychedelic Quotes

Psychedelic Quotes is a fun site offering a random quote generator displaying quotes mainly from professionals in the field of Psychiatry and Consciousness Research. As we are currently in the era of a psychedelic renaissance in regards to the re-evaluation of the psychotherapeutic potential of psychedelics, this site is offering quotes from the perspective of psychedlics as a medicine. This site is targeted towards Psychonauts. There is also an image gallery displaying some fun images, plus a day and date feature in the footer added purely for style to the page.

   The first sentence of default text, Psychedelic Medicine: A re-emerging therapeutic paradigm, is is taken from the heading of an article by Kenneth W. Tupper, PhD, Evan Wood, MD PhD, Richard Yensen, PhD, and Matthew W. Johnson, PhD. It is referenced on the National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine website.

   The second sentence,‘Psychedelics, used responsibly and with proper caution, would be for psychiatry what the microscope is for biology and medicine or the telescope is for astronomy’ by Professor Stan Grof. Referenced - From Sacred Plants to Psychotherapy: The History and Re-Emergence of Psychedelics in Medicine By Dr. Ben Sessa.
