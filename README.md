# Psychedelic Quotes
Welcome! 

Psychedelic Quotes is a fun site offering a random quote generator displaying quotes mainly from professionals in the field of Psychiatry and Consciousness Research. As we are now in the era of a psychedelic renaissance in regards to the re-evaluation of the psychotherapeutic potential of psychedelics, this site is offering quotes from the perspective of psychedelics as a medicine and tool for the psyche. The site targets Psychonauts and curious folk interested in the subject matter. There is also an image gallery displaying some fun images, plus a day and date feature in the footer added purely for style to the page. The site is designed to be responsive and assessible across various devices. The design of the site is also intentionally bold and loud with a psychedelic theme in colours, font and images.

   ### Header Text Logo 
   ![logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62209464/130655179-3788cfeb-d2c7-428f-a048-961b2a46201e.jpg)
   The text logo PSYCHEDLIC QUOTES in the header is a clickable link that refreshes the page which resets the quote generator to its default position. When hovering over the logo an underline appears to suggest it is a link.

   ### Heading
   ![logo/heading](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62209464/130656485-8ebe98a1-e061-4855-b085-b6d502b65a4c.jpg)

   #### Heading intro text is an excerpt from Michael Pollans book - How To Change Your Mind(The New Science of Psychedelics).

   The first sentence of default text, Psychedelic Medicine: A re-emerging therapeutic paradigm, is is taken from the heading of an article by Kenneth W. Tupper, PhD, Evan Wood, MD PhD, Richard Yensen, PhD, and Matthew W. Johnson, PhD. It is referenced on the National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine website.

   The second sentence,‘Psychedelics, used responsibly and with proper caution, would be for psychiatry what the microscope is for biology and medicine or the telescope is for astronomy’ by Professor Stan Grof. Referenced - From Sacred Plants to Psychotherapy: The History and Re-Emergence of Psychedelics in Medicine By Dr. Ben Sessa.
   Both sentences will disappear when the press for new quote is generated by the button.

   The button within the quote generator triggers the random quotes/author and images which are held in an array in the js file and for the purpose of style their is also another array holding various colours that are also triggered by the button.This adds a colourful changing background with each new quote.


  ### Image Gallery

  The images for the gallery are held in an array that are triggered by the previous and next button element. They were added as a fun visual element to the page.

## Testing
--------------------------------------
### Unicorn Revealer:
This dev tool helped in revealing where there was overflow from the image gallery container which was affecting the responsive layout on the iPhone 5/SE. 
### Lighthouse metrics:
Focused on improving the overall performance score by eliminating render-blocking resources which in particular had to do with the external typekit and issues with preloading. Created a second css stylesheet with the Adobe typekit and linked in html. Followed suggestions by Lighthouse to improve score: Added <link rel="preload"> and to css and js file in the header and <script...defer></script> in the body. This enabled the script to be downloaded in parallel to parsing the page, and executed after the page finished parsing. 


Added meta name="description" in html header which boosted the SEO.
### Mobile score:

### Fixed Bugs
--------------------------------------
The suggestion on jshint: Two warnings
86	['quoteText'] is better written in dot notation.
87	['quoteAuthor'] is better written in dot notation.
Added preload first then link rel="dns-prefetch" to typekit to improve pageload speed as per lighthouse suggestion to speed up third party origins. This bumped up the performance score.

### Unfixed Bugs
------------------------------
There is also at times a latency with the array of colour changes in the quote generator and also with the quotes. 

 ## Features Left to Implement
 --------------------------------  
 Add a seperate container focusing on women within the field of psychedelic research and therapy, to showcase their work.

## Deployment
-------------------------------------
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. 
The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab from the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch. Once the main branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
